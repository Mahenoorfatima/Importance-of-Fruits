    <P>One of the most popular fruit, <em><strong>Apple</strong></em> are chock-full of nutrition.

        They’re rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, such as pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. These help you manage your blood sugar levels, promote good digestion, and support gut and heart health
        
        In addition, they’re a good source of vitamin C and plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. In fact, consuming apples regularly may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, overweight, obesity, and neurological disorders.
        
        Note that most of the polyphenols in apples are located just below the skin, so be sure to eat it to reap the greatest benefits.</P>

<p>Mango is a delicious, sweet fruit that boasts an impressive nutrient profile.Like bananas, mangoes are a good source of calories — mostly from carbs.One cup (165 grams) of mango provides the following nutrients.
    
    
    <li>Calories: 99</li>
    <li>Protein: 1.4 grams</li>
    <li>Fat: 0.6 grams</li>
    <li>Carbs: 25 grams</li>
    <li>Fiber: 3 grams</li>
    <li>Vitamin C: 67% of the DV</li>
    <li>Folate: 18% of the DV</li>

<p>In addition, mango is a good source of copper, several B vitamins, and vitamins A and E. Mango is delicious on its own but also a great addition to smoothies, salsas, and summer salads. Try pairing fresh mango with higher-calorie ingredients like nuts or coconut if weight gain is your goal.</p>

<h3>
    <li>ORANGE</li>
</h3>

<br />


<p><q>Oranges are known for their high vitamin C content, providing 91% of the DV in a single fruit.</q> They’re also high in potassium, folate, thiamine (vitamin B1), fiber, and plant polyphenols (24Trusted Source).Studies have found that consuming whole oranges may lower levels of inflammation, blood pressure, cholesterol, and post-meal blood sugar.Though 100% orange juice provides a high volume of nutrients and antioxidants, it usually lacks dietary fiber. Varieties that include the pulp do include some fiber, so opt for these over juices without pulp.That said, try to eat whole oranges more often, and keep juice portions to 1 cup (235 mL) or less per serving.</p>

<h3>
    <LI>AVOCADE</LI>
</h3>

<br />

<br />

<p>Unlike most other fruits, <strong><em>avocados are high in healthy fats and low in natural sugars.</em></strong>They’re mostly made of oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat linked to better heart health. They also contain high amounts of potassium, fiber, vitamin B6, folate, vitamins E and K, and two carotenoids known as lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health.In fact, a high quality 2020 study found a significant decrease in cholesterol levels and an increase in blood lutein levels among participants who consumed an avocado per day for 5 weeks. When compared by weight, avocados are higher in calories than most other fruits. However, studies have linked them to better weight management. Researchers have proposed that this is because their high fat and fiber contents promote fullness.</p>

<h3>
    <li>LYCHEE</li>
</h3>


<br />

<br />

<p>Lychee, which is also known as litchi and Chinese cherry, is packed with nutrition.In particular, it’s a rich source of vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and many polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These include</p>
    
    <li>gallic acid</li>
    <li>chlorogenic acid</li>
    <li>catechins</li>
    <li>caffeic acid</li>

    <p>One serving of lychee is around seven small individual fruits.</p>
